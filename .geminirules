# Regimen Pro Development Manifesto

You are an expert full-stack developer. You MUST adhere to the following Professional Workflow for every task.

## 1. The Professional Workflow
Every request must follow these phases strictly:

### Phase 1: Initiation (The Anchor)
1. **Sync Workspace:** Run `npm run sync-tasks` to ensure local `/features` match GitHub.
2. **Identify Task:** Use an existing GitHub Issue ID (e.g., #4) or create a new one (`gh issue create`).
3. **Move to In Progress:** Update the project item status to "In Progress".
4. **Branch Out:** Create a task-specific branch: `git checkout -b task-[ID]-short-description`.

### Phase 2: Implementation (The Build)
1. **Code:** Implement changes following project patterns.
2. **Update Docs:** Update the local `features/GHI-[ID]_...md` file with technical implementation details.
3. **Lint:** Ensure code matches project style.

### Phase 3: UAT (User Acceptance Testing)
1. **Local Test:** Run the app locally and verify the specific logic/UI changes.
2. **User Review:** Present the changes to the user.
3. **Status Update:** Move the project item status to "UAT".
4. **Visual Sign-off:** Wait for the user to provide "Visual Sign-off".

### Phase 4: Delivery (The Pull Request)
1. **Compile:** Run `npm run build` to verify no syntax/import errors.
2. **Commit:** Use Conventional Commits: `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `refactor: ...`, `ui: ...`.
3. **PR:** Create a Pull Request (`gh pr create`) linked to the issue ("Closes #[ID]").
4. **Merge:** Merge the PR into `source` and delete the task branch.
5. **Status Update:** Move the project item status to "Testing".

### Phase 5: Cleanup & Batching
1. **Clean Sync:** Run `npm run sync-tasks` to remove the local task file.
2. **Close Issue:** Close the GitHub Issue with a summary.
3. **Batching:** Verified features accumulate in `source`. Release/Deployment is now a separate, explicit action.

## 2. Release Lifecycle (Decoupled)
Deployment to production is NOT automatic.
1. **Release Task:** When a batch of features is ready, a specific "Release" task is initiated.
2. **Deploy:** Run `npm run deploy` to push the accumulated verified state of `source` to production.

## 3. Core Architecture: The 3-Layers of Truth
All plan-related logic (Training, Nutrition, Supplements) must follow:
- **Layer 1 (Daily Overrides):** `masterLogs[dateKey].plan_overrides`.
- **Layer 2 (User Templates):** `localStorage.regimen_user_template`.
- **Layer 3 (System Defaults):** The immutable `DEFAULT_PLAN` object.
- **CRITICAL:** Never modify `DEFAULT_PLAN`.

## 4. GitHub & Project Standards
- **Branching:** `task-[ID]-description`.
- **Conventional Commits:** `type: description (fixes #[ID])`.
- **Project Board:** Every issue must have:
    - **Tier:** 1 (Initiative), 2 (Epic), 3 (Task).
    - **Work Type:** Feature, Bug, Enhancement, Refactor, Chore, Compatibility, Documentation, Security, Performance.
    - **Status Sequence:** Todo → In Progress → UAT → Testing → Done.

## 5. Technology Stack Constraints
- **Standalone PWA:** `public/regimen.html` is a single-file app.
- **Supabase:** Use `sbClient` global variable.
- **Interactivity:** Attach event handlers to `window`.

## 6. Two-Way Task Mirroring
- Always run `npm run sync-tasks` before starting and after finishing a task.
- Active tickets live in `/features`.
- Documentation and architectural guides live in `/docs`.

---

## 7. Interaction Guidelines
- **Brief Descriptions:** Always provide a brief, one-sentence description of what you are about to do BEFORE calling any tools. This ensures the user is informed of the intended action.
