# TASK-40: UI: Compact Block-Based Library Redesign with PB Highlights

### Goal
Redesign the LibraryView's day preview to be more compact, tactical, and informative by showing exercises in block-based frames and highlighting Personal Bests (PBs).

### Changes
1. Remove full set history from Library preview (it's redundant).
2. Group exercises by their blocks (Standard/Circuit) using frame borders.
3. Show 'Best Set Ever' (PB) for each exercise using high-density typography.
4. Maintain strict exercise ordering within blocks.
5. Follow 'Industrial High-Density' design standards.
