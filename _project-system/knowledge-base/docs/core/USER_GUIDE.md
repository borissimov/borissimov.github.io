## 4. The Session Logger

Once a session is active, you enter **Focus Mode**. The app acts as an intelligent assistant to guide you through the workout.

### **The "Following Shadow" Engine**
- **Intelligent Seeking:** When a set is finished, the app automatically scans for and focuses on the **next incomplete task**.
- **Accordion Handoff:** Only one training block is expanded at a time to minimize distraction.
- **Auto-Advance:** For timed blocks, the system moves to the next item automatically when the timer completes.

### **Visual Language (States)**
- **Upcoming (Gray):** Tasks yet to be performed.
- **Focused (Orange):** The current active task. If you move away from the recommended set, the target will "breathe" orange to call for attention.
- **Complete (Green):** Tasks where all prescribed sets are logged.

### **Logging Performance**
- **Inputs:** Enter your actual Weight and Reps (or Time/Distance depending on the exercise).
- **Save:** Tap the checkmark to record the set. Progress bars will update instantly.
