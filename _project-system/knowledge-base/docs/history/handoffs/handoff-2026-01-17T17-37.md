# Context Handoff: Session 2026-01-17T17-37

## Session Goal
Enhance UI elements (Date Selector, Account Badge), establish GitHub Project workflow, and fix the "Set as Default" login redirect.

## Key Actions & Changes
1.  **UI Optimizations (`public/regimen.html`)**:
    *   **Smart Abbreviations:** Configured `renderDateScroller` to display "AR" and "META" on date cards while keeping full names ("ACTIVE RECOVERY") in headers.
    *   **Consolidated Auth UI:** Moved the User ID input into the "Logged in as" badge to save vertical space.
2.  **App Portal (`index.html`)**:
    *   **Fixed Redirect Logic:** Restored `initPortal` and `sbPortalClient` to fix broken login.
    *   **Default App Preference:** Updated `handleLogout` to NOT clear the `regimen_default_app` key, allowing the preference to persist.
    *   **Auto-Launch:** Updated `onAuthStateChange` to immediately redirect to the default app upon successful login.
3.  **React App (`src/`)**:
    *   Added **"Exit to Portal"** button in the Side Menu (Header.jsx) to allow users to return to the launcher.
4.  **Project Management**:
    *   Authenticated `gh` CLI and created **"Regimen Pro Project"**.
    *    synced local feature tickets to GitHub Issues (#12 FEATURE-005, #13 FEATURE-006).

## Current State
*   Portal (`index.html`) automatically redirects to the default app if set.
*   Regimen Pro UI is more compact and readable.
*   GitHub Issues are the source of truth for task tracking.

## Pending Items
*   None specific to this session.
