# Context Handoff: Session 2026-01-18T21-18

## Session Goal
Implement **TASK-22 (Jan 18-24 Training Update)**, decouple specific weights from system defaults, and establish a safe workflow for weekly updates.

## Key Actions & Changes
1.  **Surgical Data Update**:
    *   Used Python scripts (`apply_update.py`) to replace the `PLAN_JAN_18` block in `public/regimen.html` without breaking the file structure.
    *   Applied AI-optimized weights and hints for the week of Jan 18-24.
2.  **Architectural Cleanup**:
    *   **Clean Defaults:** Stripped specific weights (e.g., "26kg") from `DEFAULT_PLAN`, replacing them with generic placeholders ("-"). This ensures future weeks start with a clean slate.
    *   **Migration v75:** Triggered to apply the new clean defaults.
3.  **Tooling**:
    *   Created **`scripts/apply_weekly_plan.py`**: A reusable script that accepts a plan file and version string to safely update `regimen.html`.
    *   **Memory Saved:** "The script 'scripts/apply_weekly_plan.py' should be used for all future weekly regimen updates."
4.  **Deployment**:
    *   Merged `task-22-full-update` into `main`.
    *   Deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Current State
*   **Jan 18-24:** Shows specific AI targets.
*   **Other Dates:** Show generic defaults (unless overridden by user).
*   **Update Workflow:** Standardized via Python script to prevent syntax errors in the large HTML file.

## Pending Items
*   Universal supplement schedule change (mentioned but not implemented).
