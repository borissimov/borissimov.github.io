# Context Handoff: Session 2026-01-20T19-52

## Session Goal
Major UI overhaul to "Industrial High-Density Design", refactoring of the core engine in `RegimenProApp.jsx`, and implementation of new features like Manual Logging.

## Key Actions & Changes
1.  **UI Overhaul ("Progress Hub")**:
    *   Implemented a high-fidelity "Industrial" design with a dark aesthetic.
    *   Added a draggable floating action button (FAB) for quick actions.
    *   Restored the "Calendar Scroller" and activity cards.
    *   **Critical Revert:** Restored the "Small Right-Aligned Start Button" in the header after user feedback rejected the full-width button.
2.  **Engine Refactoring**:
    *   **State Hoisting:** Moved `workoutLabel`, `globalPercent`, and `engineStats` to the top level of `RegimenProApp` to resolve `ReferenceError` crashes in modals.
    *   **Data Isolation:** Enforced a strict relational rendering loop (`Day -> Workout -> Block -> Exercise`) to prevent data leakage where workouts would show unrelated exercises.
    *   **Performance Pills:** Restored name-based "pills" for quick performance review.
3.  **New Features**:
    *   **Manual Log Mode:** Added ability to log workouts retroactively.
    *   **Archive View:** Fixed the exercise history view.

## Current State
*   The app is in a stable "Tactical V1" state.
*   The UI is modern and responsive.
*   The codebase uses a clean separation of concerns between the UI shell and the `useTrainingStore`.

## Pending Items
*   User intent to create a `MasterPlan v2` branch was stated but not executed in this session.
