# Context Handoff: Session 2026-01-23T09-57

## Session Goal
Implement **Active Session Visibility** in the Master Agenda, improve application navigation context, and perform dependency cleanup.

## Key Actions & Changes
1.  **Feature Implementation (Agenda & Navigation)**:
    *   **Active Session Banner:** Added a banner to `MasterAgendaView.jsx` that appears when a workout is in progress, allowing quick access back to the session.
    *   **Context-Aware Navigation:** Implemented `lastView` persistence in `useProgramStore`. The "Back" button now correctly returns to the Agenda or Library depending on where the user started.
    *   **Fixed Navigation:** Updated the barbell icon in the Agenda header to correctly navigate to the `'library'` view.
2.  **Codebase Cleanup**:
    *   Removed unused npm dependencies to reduce bundle size: `date-fns`, `react-calendar`, `tailwind-merge`, `web-push`, `pg`.
3.  **Deployment**:
    *   Merged `feat/agenda-active-session` into `main`.
    *   Deployed updates to production.

## Current State
*   **Master Agenda:** Now serves as a true dashboard, showing active status.
*   **Navigation:** smoother and more intuitive.
*   **Dependencies:** Leaner `package.json`.

## Pending Items
*   None specific to this session.
