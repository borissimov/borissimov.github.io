# Context Handoff: Session 2026-01-25 (The "Bridge" Session)

## Session Goal
Analyze historical chat logs, generate comprehensive chronological handoffs, and establish a permanent Project Management System in `_project-system/`.

## Key Actions & Changes
1.  **Historical Analysis**:
    *   Synthesized 10 previous sessions into individual handoff files in `context_handoff/`.
    *   Identified critical lessons (e.g., the `sed` corruption incident, UUID enforcement).
2.  **System Formalization**:
    *   Created `_project-system/SYSTEM_CONTEXT.md`: The single source of truth for current architecture and state.
    *   Created `_project-system/PROJECT_WISDOM.md`: A repository of tribal knowledge, design preferences, and the "Graveyard" of past mistakes.
    *   Created `_project-system/DEVELOPER_PROTOCOL.md`: Explicit instructions for future AI instances on how to startup, develop, and maintain these living documents.

## Current State
*   **Documentation:** Fully caught up with the code. The project now has a "brain" that exists outside of specific chat history.
*   **Workflow:** Transitioned from chronological logs to a "Living Dashboard" model.

## Instructions for Next Session
**Do not rely solely on chronological handoffs.** 
1.  Read `_project-system/DEVELOPER_PROTOCOL.md` first.
2.  Follow the startup routine.
3.  Treat `SYSTEM_CONTEXT.md` as the active map of the codebase.

## Final Closure (11:15 AM)
- Verified all files in project root: `/home/dev/projects/react-master-plan/`.
- Cleaned up 43MB log file and temporary local folders.
- Finalized .geminirules to enforce new startup protocol.
- Session successfully transitioned to "Living Dashboard" architecture.
- Ready for context reset.
